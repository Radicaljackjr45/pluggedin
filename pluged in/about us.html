									Welcome to Plugged IN! My name is Charlene, and I am the founder of Plugged IN Therapies and a professional counselor. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Counseling and have extensive experience in the mental health sector. Throughout my career, I have worked with individuals across various demographics, including children, youth in schools, university students, individuals with disabilities, and community groups.<br><br>


									I am deeply grateful to have been part of many transformative journeys, witnessing individuals reclaim their lives from challenges such as depression, anxiety, grief, and addiction. It has been an honor to see clients rediscover their identity, regain their freedom, and heal as they grow to reach their full potential. There is no greater fulfillment for me than supporting people through their personal journeys.
									
									I believe that mental health care should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their circumstances. Having personally experienced the barriers many individuals face in accessing timely and effective mental health support, I founded Plugged IN to bridge this gap. My mission is to provide a safe, welcoming virtual space where individuals can explore their thoughts and feelings, find solutions, achieve goals, heal, and enhance their overall mental well-being through personalized counseling and support.<br><br>
									
									My approach integrates evidence-based practices with compassion and understanding, ensuring that each client feels heard, respected, and valued. Whether you are seeking personal counseling, group support sessions, or workshops, I am here to help you navigate your path toward mental wellness.
									
									I look forward to connecting with you and supporting your mental health journey.</p>
